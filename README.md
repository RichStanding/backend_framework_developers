base project for backend code



**Develop the microservice:**
- Start from the main branch ```git checkout main```
- To add a new feature make a new branch from main ```git branch [FEATURE_BRANCH_NAME]```
- Move to the feature branch ```git checkout [FEATURE_BRANCH_NAME]```
- To install a library use the command ```poetry add [LIBRARY_NAME_AND_VERSION]```
- Write your methods in the ```main_service.py``` and return your results in the following format ```{"results": []}```
- Add and commit your changes (for guidance see the Add & Commit Changes section of [this tutorial](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands/))
- Push to the feature branch ```git push origin [FEATURE_BRANCH_NAME]```
- Create a pull request to [YOUR_BRANCH_NAME] (for guidance see [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request))
- Ask one or two developers/product owner for review
